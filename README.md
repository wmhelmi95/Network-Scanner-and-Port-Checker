# Network Scanner and Port Checker

This is a personal project I've developed to automate network scanning, port checking, and Nmap-based enumeration tasks. It's designed to simplify the process of scanning IP addresses and gathering information about open ports and potential vulnerabilities.

## Features

- Scan IP addresses using a CIDR range or IP address file.
- Check if hosts are reachable and display their status.
- Perform port scanning and save results to files.
- Run Nmap enumeration scripts to gather information about open ports.
- Perform SSL cipher enumeration.
- Perform Nmap vulnerability scanning.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the script using `python network_scanner.py`.
5. Follow the prompts to select the scanning option and provide the target.
6. View the results in the `nd` directory.
